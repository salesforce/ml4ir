# ml4ir: Machine Learning Library for Information Retrieval

## Setup
#### Requirements
* python3.6+
* pip3
* docker (version 18.09+ tested)

#### Docker (Recommended)
We have set up a `docker-compose.yml` file for building and using docker containers to train models.

To run unit tests
```
docker-compose up
```

To invoke ml4ir with custom arguments with docker, run
```
/bin/bash tools/run_docker.sh ml4ir \
	python3 ml4ir/base/pipeline.py
    <args>
```

For ranking applications, specifically, use
```
/bin/bash tools/run_docker.sh ml4ir \
	python3 ml4ir/applications/ranking/pipeline.py
    <args>
```

Refer to usage section below for details on how to run ml4ir - ranking

Check `ml4ir/applications/ranking/scripts/example_run.sh` for a predefined example run.

To run example invocation of ranking application with docker,
```
/bin/bash python/ml4ir/applications/ranking/scripts/example_run.sh
```

#### Virtual Environment
Install virtualenv
```
pip3 install virtualenv
```

Create new python3 virtual environment inside your git repo (it's .gitignored, don't worry)
```
cd $PLACE_YOU_CAlLED_GIT_CLONE/ml4ir
python3 -m venv python/env/.ml4ir_venv3
```

Activate virtualenv
```
cd python/
source env/.ml4ir_venv3/bin/activate
```

Install all dependencies (carefully)
```
pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
pip install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Note, there are some AWS incompatibilities, gotta fix that, but you can ignore them for now

```

Note that pre-commit-hooks are required, and installed as a requirement if needed. 
If an error results that they didn't install, execute `pre-commit install` to install git hooks in your .git/ directory.


Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`/python
```

## Usage
The entrypoint into the training or evaluation functionality of ml4ir is through `ml4ir/base/pipeline.py` and for application specific overrides, look at `ml4ir/applications/<eg: ranking>/pipeline.py

### ml4ir Library
To use ml4ir as a deep learning library to build relevance models, look at the walkthrough under `notebooks/PointwiseRankingDemo.ipynb` or `notebooks/PointwiseRankingDemo.html`(contains architecture diagrams). The notebook walks one through building, training, saving, and the entire life cycle of a `RelevanceModel` from the bottom up. Additionally, the HTML version also sheds light on the design of ml4ir and the data format used.

### Applications - Ranking
#### Examples
Using TFRecord
```
python ml4ir/applications/ranking/pipeline.py \
--data_dir ml4ir/applications/ranking/tests/data/tfrecord \
--feature_config ml4ir/applications/ranking/tests/data/tfrecord/feature_config.yaml \
--run_id test \
--data_format tfrecord \
--execution_mode train_inference_evaluate
```

Using CSV
```
python ml4ir/applications/ranking/pipeline.py \
--data_dir ml4ir/applications/ranking/tests/data/csv \
--feature_config ml4ir/applications/ranking/tests/data/csv/feature_config.yaml \
--run_id test \
--data_format csv \
--execution_mode train_inference_evaluate
```

Running in inference mode using the default serving signature
```
python ml4ir/applications/ranking/pipeline.py \
--data_dir ml4ir/applications/ranking/tests/data/tfrecord \
--feature_config ml4ir/applications/ranking/tests/data/tfrecord/feature_config.yaml \
--run_id test \
--data_format tfrecord \
--model_file `pwd`/models/test/final/default \
--execution_mode inference_only

NOTE: Make sure to add the right data and feature config before training models.
TODO: describe how to do this

## Running Tests
To run all the python based tests under `ml4ir`
```
python3 -m pytest
```

To run specific tests, 
```
python3 -m pytest /path/to/test/module
```
